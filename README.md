The JavaScript code consists of two parts, index.js and lib.js, working together to authenticate API requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

index.js: 

This module acts as a lambda function handler. 
It imports the lib module and invokes lib.authenticate with the incoming event object. 
If the authentication is successful, it returns the authenticated data; otherwise, it logs the error and returns "Unauthorized".

lib.js: 

This module handles the authentication logic. 
It first retrieves the JWT from the incoming request, decodes it, and then verifies its validity using the signing key obtained from a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint, as defined in the environment variables. 
If the JWT is valid, it returns a policy document allowing the request, along with the user's principal ID and scope; if not, it throws an error indicating an invalid token.
